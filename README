NAME
    Acme::UTF1

SYNOPSIS
      use Acme::UTF1;
      use Encode qw( encode decode );
  
      # read utf-1 bytes from the input
      while ( my $bytes = <> ) {
        # decode to characters, and print
        my $chars = decode('utf-1', $bytes);
        print $chars;
      }

DESCRIPTION
    Implements the utf-1 encoding for perl.

    utf-1 is a way of encoding unicode characters so that they can be sent
    across networks that are unable to handle the full 8 bits normally
    required by utf-8. It will convert any character into a sequence of
    bytes, of which only the bottom bit is set, and is able to convert such
    a sequence back to characters.

FUTURE PLANS
    Rather than converting to bytes where only one bit is set, we could
    produce much denser bit sequences
    Using only the bottom bit leaves us open to interference. It might be
    better to use the _entire_ byte, sending all 1s, or all 0s, so we can
    use noisy channels. Or for data-hiding purposes, we could use the parity
    of the byte to hold the data, and send otherwise completely random
    noise.
    utf-1 would be ideal for hiding messages in the lowest bit of otherwise
    meaningful but noisy data.

SEE ALSO
    utf-7.
